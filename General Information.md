# Short-Form Hackathon Workflow + Instructions

Short-format hackathons are 4-hour "bursts". These are designed to encourage daily coding practice. The goal in short-format hackathons is to learn to build new types of projects every week.

## Goals

The goal for this hackathon series is to help you:

1. *Learn* new skills, technologies and patterns.
2. *Deploy* portfolio pieces that employers find impressive.
3. *Form a habit* of regular coding by joining Mintbean hackathons 2x a week.

## Schedule

* 12pm-4pm.
* Mondays and Wednesdays (excluding Ontario statutory holidays).

## How this works

1. **Deploy** a simple placeholder application to a public URL (this can be anything -- "Hello World", or maybe simple boilerplate. Even a blank page is fine)
1. **Register** your project using [this link](https://airtable.com/shr8pv80G6IRWfUW6)
1. **Code** on your project
1. **Deploy** the final version of your project to your registered public URL before the timeline
1. **Vote** on the application of your choice
