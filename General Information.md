# The Mintbean Community

## Welcome!

Thank you for joining us today in our hackathon! We're so excited to have you here. Mintbean is more than a series of hackathons -- we are a community, and we're constantly building new bridges for software developers to get ahead in their careers.

## Goals

These short-format hackathons are the heart of our community. They're 4-hour "bursts" that are designed to make it easier for you to find a job and get ahead in your career. 

The basic formula here is: `Chances of getting a job = (Building your portfolio + Posting to + Applying to jobs) * Frequency`, so the more projects you build and the more you post to social media, the more attractive you are to potential employers.

This hackathon's goal is to help you:

1. **Build portfolio projects** to make your Github profile impressive to employers.
2. **Post your projects** on social media (LinkedIn and Twitter)
3. **Frequently repeat**. We do these hackathons 2x a week, as part of a community.

## How to use these hackathons

In a nutshell: attend them frequently. Attending both the Monday and the Wednesday hackathons is a great way to boost your portfolio and your social media visibility, making you extremely marketable to employers.

## Schedule

* 12pm-4pm.
* Mondays and Wednesdays (excluding Ontario statutory holidays).

## Steps

### Programming

1. **Deploy a simple placeholder application** like a "hello world" to CodePen, Heroku, or a similar site.
1. **Register** your new project's live URL using [this link](https://airtable.com/shr8pv80G6IRWfUW6).
1. **Code** on your project until the time runs out.

### Submitting + Voting

1. **Deploy the final version of your project** to your registered public URL before the timeline.
1. **Vote** on the application of your choice.
1. **Return** for our next hackathon.

### Social media & portfolio section

In this very useful section, we update our portfolios, tweet and post our projects, and like/comment on each others' portfolios publicly.

1. Post your project URL on social media
2. Like & comment on each other's posts
